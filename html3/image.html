<!-- Task 3
Set up the basic document template for the html file.
-   Collect 3 images describing your personality
-   Each image should have a name with headings.
-   Each image should have a sentence or 2, explaining the image/what is happening in the image
-   make sure to add a "back to top" button at the bottom of the page.
-   use the Life Choices logo and link it so that it redirects you to the Life Choices website
    Think about what the content in the link that they shouldclick on might be. (Normally it 
    would be text, but what is it now?). -->
